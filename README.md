Haptic Audio Player for SpidarMouse

This project was completed at the Fuji-Xerox "Schockathon" Haptic Interface Hackathon held in Yokohama, Japan Aug. 2-3, 2014.

The prototype realizes an audio player that guides the user through haptic cues. This could be useful in situations where the user cannot or should not look at the touch screen, e.g., when driving a car. 

## Hardware Requirement


The prototype requires the [Spidar Mouse!](http://sklab-www.pi.titech.ac.jp/blog/introduction/spidar-mouse/) to work.
